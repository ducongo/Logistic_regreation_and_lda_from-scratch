# Logistic_regression_and_lda_from
Implemented a logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis from scratch to test on sonar and parkinson data

How to run code (using Colab):
	1. Open up Colab
	2. Upload any one of the ".pyinb" files (File > Upload notebook...)
	3. When the file is uploaded, select "Run All" (Runtime > Run all, OR just use Ctrl+F9)
	4. Look at code box #4/5 (There are comments that say pretty much exactly what will be 
	   written here but nonetheless). You'll want to have the 3 .py files located somewhere
	   on your computer that you can readily access for this step.
		a) When this box is being run, there will pop up a small box that says "Choose File".
		   Click it, and navigate to where you have stored the .py files. The first file to 
		   upload is "logisticregression.py". Select it and upload/open it.
		b) When the file above is done uploading, there will be a second "Choose File" option.
		   Click it and upload "kfold.py".
		c) When the file above has completed uploading, there will be a 3rd "Choose File" option.
		   Click it and upload "lda.py".
	   
	   IMPORTANT NOTE:
		   If you run into any errors, usually it's because you either waited to long to select 
		   the choose file option, or Colab just had a hissy-fit. Just return to step 3 and try 
		   again (ie. Run the program again). It'll fix it.

If the url for the dataset isn't working for whatever reason, you'll have to upload the dataset 
provided somewhere public (like github) and switch the link in code box 2 with the link of
wherever you've uploaded the dataset.
